IMPORTANT: The specifications have been completely revised to v2.0 (production-grade).

COMPLETED TASKS:
- P1-01: Foundation ✅
- P1-02: Security ✅  
- P1-03: Portal Integration ✅

NEXT TASK: P1-04 - PipeWire Integration

Read the COMPLETE specification at:
https://github.com/lamco-admin/wayland-rdp/blob/main/phase1-tasks/TASK-P1-04-PIPEWIRE-COMPLETE.md

This is a 73KB, 1500+ line PRODUCTION-GRADE specification with:
- Complete PipeWire C API implementation
- DMA-BUF zero-copy path (complete)
- 21 format conversions specified
- Multi-stream handling (8 monitors)
- 800+ lines of complete production code
- NO TODOs or placeholders

Implement src/pipewire/ module with:
1. Complete PipeWire connection using portal FD
2. Format negotiation with SPA Pods
3. Buffer handling (DMA-BUF + memory buffers)
4. Frame extraction and VideoFrame creation
5. Multi-stream coordinator
6. Integration tests
7. Example program

Dependencies (already in Cargo.toml):
- pipewire = "0.9.2"
- libspa = "0.9.2"

Success criteria:
- PipeWire connects using portal FD
- Frames received at 30 FPS
- DMA-BUF zero-copy works (when available)
- All pixel formats handled
- Multi-monitor streams coordinated
- All tests pass

Follow the specification exactly - it includes complete implementations.

Estimated duration: 3-5 days
