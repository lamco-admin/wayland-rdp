## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

**Before opening an issue:**
1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Run diagnostics: `lamco-rdp-server --diagnose`
3. Gather version info: `lamco-rdp-server --version`
4. Include log output if relevant

**Good bug reports include:**
- Your Linux distribution and version
- Desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, wlroots compositor)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Relevant log excerpts

### Suggesting Features

**Feature requests should include:**
- Use case description
- Why existing features don't solve this need
- Proposed implementation approach (if you have ideas)
- Willingness to contribute code (if applicable)

**Note:** We prioritize features that:
- Work across multiple compositors (not GNOME-only or KDE-only)
- Align with Wayland/Portal security model
- Don't break existing functionality

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust 1.77+
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install nasm libssl-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev libva-dev \
  libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libdbus-1-dev libpam0g-dev

# Install dependencies (Fedora/RHEL)
sudo dnf install nasm openssl-devel pipewire-devel libva-devel \
  wayland-devel libxkbcommon-devel dbus-devel pam-devel
```

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lamco-admin/lamco-rdp-server
cd lamco-rdp-server

# Build
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with verbose logging
cargo run -- -c config.toml -vvv
```

### Code Style

**We follow standard Rust conventions:**

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for issues
cargo clippy --all-features

# Both must pass before submitting PR
```

**Linting standards:**
- No `unsafe` code without justification
- All public APIs must have documentation
- Add tests for new functionality
- Keep functions focused and readable
