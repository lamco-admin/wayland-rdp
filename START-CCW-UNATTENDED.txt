SPECIFICATIONS V2.0 COMPLETE - Get Back On Track

CURRENT STATE:
- Specifications completely revised to production-grade (v2.0)
- 3 tasks implemented (Foundation, Security, Portal) ✅
- Cargo.toml MISSING IronRDP dependency (CRITICAL FIX NEEDED)

YOUR MISSION (UNATTENDED - Work Overnight):

1. UPDATE CARGO.TOML (CRITICAL - 30 min)
   Read: 02-TECHNOLOGY-STACK.md
   Add: ironrdp-server = { version = "0.9.0", features = ["helper"] }
   Add: pipewire = { version = "0.9.2", features = ["v0_3_77"] }
   Add: libspa = "0.9.2"
   Update: rustls to 0.23.35, tokio-rustls to 0.26.4
   Verify: cargo check
   Commit: "Update Cargo.toml to v2.0 specifications with IronRDP"

2. IMPLEMENT P1-04: PIPEWIRE INTEGRATION (4-6 hours)
   Read: phase1-tasks/TASK-P1-04-PIPEWIRE-COMPLETE.md (1500+ lines, 100% complete spec)
   
   Create:
   - src/pipewire/mod.rs (coordinator)
   - src/pipewire/stream.rs (PipeWire connection using portal FD)
   - src/pipewire/format.rs (format negotiation, 21 formats)
   - src/pipewire/receiver.rs (frame extraction, multi-stream)
   - examples/pipewire_frames.rs (demo program)
   - tests/integration/pipewire_test.rs (#[ignore] test)
   
   The spec has 800+ lines of COMPLETE production code. Follow it exactly.
   
   Verify:
   - cargo build --lib succeeds
   - cargo test passes
   
   Commit: "Implement P1-04: Complete PipeWire integration with DMA-BUF"

3. CREATE PROGRESS REPORT
   Document what you completed in PROGRESS-REPORT.md

4. PUSH EVERYTHING
   git push -u origin <your-branch-name>

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Cargo.toml has ironrdp-server ✅
- PipeWire module implemented ✅
- Builds successfully ✅
- Tests pass ✅
- Committed and pushed ✅

REFERENCES:
