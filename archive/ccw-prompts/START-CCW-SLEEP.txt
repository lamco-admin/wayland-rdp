DEPENDENCY CONFLICT SOLVED ✅

SOLUTION: ironrdp metacrate with server-only features

EXACT CARGO.TOML TO USE:

```toml
[dependencies]
ironrdp = { version = "0.13.0", default-features = false, features = ["server", "tokio", "svc"] }
```

KEY: default-features = false (disables connector, avoids sspi conflicts!)

Copy complete Cargo.toml from: CCW-USE-THIS-EXACT-CARGO.txt

Then:
1. rm Cargo.lock && cargo clean && cargo check
2. Implement PipeWire: phase1-tasks/TASK-P1-04-PIPEWIRE-COMPLETE.md

Work overnight. Use exact dependencies. Good night! 🌙
