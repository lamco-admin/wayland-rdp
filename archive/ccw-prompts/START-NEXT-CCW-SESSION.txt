I'm continuing development of wrd-server (Wayland Remote Desktop Server).

COMPLETED:
- P1-01: Foundation (config, main, logging) ✅
- P1-02: Security (TLS, auth, certificates) ✅  
- P1-03: Portal Integration (ashpd, screen capture, input injection) ✅

NEXT TASK: PipeWire Integration (P1-04)

Objective: Connect to PipeWire using the file descriptor from the portal module and receive video frames.

Implement src/pipewire/ module with:
1. PipeWire connection using FD from PortalSessionHandle
2. Frame reception (width, height, pixel data, format)
3. Multi-stream support (multiple monitors)
4. VideoFrame struct for output
5. Integration test (tests/integration/pipewire_test.rs)
6. Example program (examples/pipewire_frames.rs)

Dependencies already in Cargo.toml:
- pipewire = "0.9.2"
- libspa = "0.9.2"

Success criteria:
- PipeWire connects using portal FD
- Frames received at ~30 FPS
- Frame data accessible
- cargo build succeeds
- Example demonstrates frame reception

See CCW-CONTINUE-SESSION.md in repo for complete details.

Estimated duration: 3-5 days
