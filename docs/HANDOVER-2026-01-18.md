## Tasks Awaiting Your Decisions

### Task 1: Distribution Channel Decisions

**Your distribution roadmap** (`~/lamco-admin/pipelines/DISTRIBUTION-ROADMAP.md`) recommends:

#### Tier 1 - Essential (80% users)

**1. Flathub Submission**
- **Status:** Manifest ready, needs MetaInfo XML + icons
- **Why:** 4M+ users, CDN distribution, maximum visibility
- **Effort:** 2-4 hours first time
- **Requires YOUR oversight:**
  - MetaInfo XML creation (app description, screenshots)
  - Icon design (128x128 PNG minimum, SVG preferred)
  - Screenshot selection
  - Flathub PR submission
- **BSL Compatible:** YES (shows as "Proprietary")
- **Documentation:** You have procedures in lamco-admin

**Decision needed:** Submit to Flathub for v0.9.0? Or wait for v1.0.0?

---

**2. AppImage**
- **Status:** Not started
- **Why:** Direct downloads, zero-installation, portable
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours setup, then automated via GitHub Actions
- **Requires:**
  - AppImageBuilder recipe
  - GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/appimage.yml)
- **BSL Compatible:** YES
- **Automation:** Once set up, automatic on every release tag

**Decision needed:** Set up AppImage automation? Priority?

---

#### Tier 2 - Good Reach

**3. AUR (Arch User Repository)**
- **Status:** Not started
- **Why:** Arch Linux ecosystem, community-maintainable
- **Effort:** 30 minutes setup
- **Requires:**
  - AUR account
  - PKGBUILD file (cargo-aur can generate)
- **BSL Compatible:** YES
- **Maintenance:** Often community takes over

**Decision needed:** Publish to AUR? When?

---

**4. Copr (Fedora/RHEL)**
- **Status:** Not started
- **Why:** Alternative to OBS for Fedora/RHEL users
- **Effort:** 1-2 hours setup
- **Requires:**
  - Fedora Account System (FAS) account
  - Adapt RPM spec from OBS
- **BSL Compatible:** YES
- **Overlap:** OBS already covers Fedora/RHEL

**Decision needed:** Worth setting up given OBS overlap?

---

#### Tier 3 - Continue

**5. OBS**
- **Status:** ✅ Active, builds running
- **Action:** Monitor builds, verify packages when complete

---

### Task 2: Website Implementation

**Location:** You have website content drafts in:
- `~/wayland/wrd-server-specs/docs/website/` (8 files)
  - INDEX.md
  - PRODUCT-PAGE.md
  - TECHNOLOGY-*.md
  - COMPARISON.md
  - ROADMAP.md
  - lamco-rdp-server-website-content.zip

**Status:** Content exists, needs to go on lamco.ai

**What you'll handle:**
- Integrate with lamco.ai website
- Use documentation as source (DISTRO-TESTING-MATRIX, FEATURE-SUPPORT-MATRIX, etc.)
- Publish support matrix, feature details, installation instructions

**No action needed from me** - this is your domain

---

### Task 3: Immediate Publicizing You Can Manage

**Now that v0.9.0 is published:**

#### Option A: Soft Announcement
**Where:**
- GitHub Discussions (if enabled)
- Personal blog/social media
- Relevant subreddits (r/linux, r/wayland, r/selfhosted)

**Message:**
"lamco-rdp-server v0.9.0 is now available. Professional RDP server for Wayland/Linux with multi-strategy session persistence. Install via Flatpak: [GitHub link]. Native packages building for Fedora/RHEL/Debian."

#### Option B: Wait for Verification
- Wait for OBS builds to complete
- Test at least one native package installation
- Then announce with "available via Flatpak and native packages"

#### Option C: Focused Outreach
**Target specific communities:**
- GNOME/KDE developer forums (Wayland RDP solution)
- Enterprise Linux forums (RHEL alternative to VNC)
- Homelab communities (self-hosted remote desktop)

**Assets ready:**
- GitHub Release page
- README with complete feature list
- CHANGELOG with tested platforms
- Installation instructions

---

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Monitor OBS builds** - Check if packages built successfully
   - Access: https://192.168.10.8
   - Check: Build Results tab
   - Verify: Download and test one RPM/DEB

2. **Test Flatpak installation** - Verify it works on clean system
   - Download from GitHub Release
   - Install and run
   - Verify basic functionality (--help, --show-capabilities)

3. **Decide on soft announcement** - Announce v0.9.0 availability?
   - GitHub Discussions
   - Relevant communities
   - Or wait for broader channel availability

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. **Flathub decision** - Submit now or wait?
   - If now: Create MetaInfo XML, icons, screenshots
   - If later: Wait for v1.0.0 after field validation

5. **AppImage decision** - Automate or skip?
   - Benefits: Portable, direct downloads
   - Effort: 1-2 hours one-time setup
   - Value: Moderate (Flatpak covers most users)

6. **Website integration** - Publish on lamco.ai
   - Use existing content drafts
   - Feature support matrix
   - Installation instructions
   - Tested platforms

### Medium-term (Next Month)

7. **AUR/Copr decisions** - Which to activate?
   - AUR: Low effort, community maintainable
   - Copr: Overlaps with OBS

8. **Field validation** - Gather user feedback
   - Installation issues
   - Feature requests
   - Bug reports

9. **v1.0.0 planning** - Stable release criteria
   - What needs testing before 1.0?
   - Which distribution channels for 1.0?
