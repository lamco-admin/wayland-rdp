## FAQ Section

**Do I need a license for personal use?**
No. Personal and home use is completely free.

**What counts as a server?**
Each installation of lamco-rdp-server on a distinct machine or VM. Development, testing, and staging environments don't count—only production use.

**What if my company grows past the threshold?**
Purchase a commercial license when your organization exceeds both 3 employees and $1M annual revenue.

**Can I upgrade my license later?**
Yes. Contact us to apply your previous purchase toward an upgrade.

**What happens after December 31, 2028?**
The software becomes Apache-2.0 licensed. No commercial license is required by anyone after that date. Your perpetual license remains valid—the software simply becomes free for everyone.

**Is there a trial period?**
The software is fully functional without a license for evaluation. If you need a commercial license, we recommend testing thoroughly before purchasing.
