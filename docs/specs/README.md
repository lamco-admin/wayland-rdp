# Specifications

This directory previously contained pre-implementation planning specifications.

These documents have been archived to `docs/archive/specs-historical/` as they represent historical planning documents from before the implementation was completed.

## Current Documentation

For current, accurate documentation, see:

- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture/COMPREHENSIVE-ARCHITECTURE-AUDIT-2025-12-27.md`
- **Color Infrastructure**: `docs/architecture/NVENC-AND-COLOR-INFRASTRUCTURE.md`
- **IronRDP Integration**: `docs/ironrdp/IRONRDP-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`

## Historical Specs (Archived)

The following documents are available in `docs/archive/specs-historical/`:

- `00-MASTER-SPECIFICATION.md` - Original project planning document
- `01-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Initial architecture design (predates EGFX implementation)
- `02-TECHNOLOGY-STACK.md` - Dependency planning
- `03-PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md` - Module organization
- `04-DATA-STRUCTURES.md` - Type definitions
- `05-PROTOCOL-SPECIFICATIONS.md` - RDP protocol details
- `PHASE-1-SPECIFICATION.md` - Phase 1 task planning
- `PHASE-2-SPECIFICATION.md` - Phase 2 task planning

These were valuable during development but the implementation has evolved significantly.
