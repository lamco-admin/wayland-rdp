## FAQ

**Q: What counts as a "server"?**
A: Each installation of lamco-rdp-server on a distinct machine or VM counts as one server.

**Q: Can I use one license for development and production?**
A: Development, testing, and staging environments don't count against your server limit. Only production use counts.

**Q: What if I exceed my server limit?**
A: Please upgrade to an appropriate tier. This is honor system - we trust you to be honest.

**Q: Do I need a license if I'm a freelancer with clients?**
A: If you personally have ≤3 employees and <$1M revenue, you're covered by the free grant, even if your clients are larger. The client would need their own license if they operate the servers themselves.

**Q: Can I resell or redistribute lamco-rdp-server?**
A: You can redistribute the software (it's source-available), but you cannot create a competing RDP server or VDI product. Service providers can offer it as part of their managed services with the Service Provider license.

**Q: What happens to my license after 2028-12-31?**
A: The software becomes Apache-2.0 licensed. No commercial license is needed by anyone after that date.
