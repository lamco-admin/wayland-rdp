```

### Full Bio (Sponsors profile page)

```
Hi, I'm Greg Lamberson, founder of Lamco Development.

I build open source libraries and tools that make complex technology accessible. My current focus is Linux remote desktop infrastructure—specifically, bringing professional RDP capabilities to Wayland desktops.

## What I'm Working On

**lamco-rdp-server** — A Wayland-native RDP server for Linux with hardware-accelerated H.264 encoding, AVC444 for crystal-clear text, and premium performance features. The first RDP server built specifically for XDG Desktop Portals.

**Open Source Crates** — The foundation libraries that power lamco-rdp-server are published under MIT/Apache-2.0:
- lamco-portal (XDG Desktop Portal integration)
- lamco-pipewire (PipeWire screen capture)
- lamco-video (video frame processing)
- lamco-rdp-input (input event translation)
- lamco-rdp-clipboard (clipboard synchronization)

**NetKit** — Kotlin Multiplatform libraries for WiFi analysis and network diagnostics, published on Maven Central.

## Why Sponsor?

Your sponsorship directly funds:
- Continued development of open source libraries
- Bug fixes and security updates
- Documentation and examples
- Upstream contributions to IronRDP and the Linux desktop ecosystem

lamco-rdp-server is free for personal use and small businesses. Sponsorships help keep it that way while funding ongoing development.
